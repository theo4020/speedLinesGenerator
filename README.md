# Animated Speed Lines Generator – Documentation

## Overview

The **Animated Speed Lines Generator** is a Blender add-on that enables artists and technical animators to rapidly create animated 3D speed lines in a designated spatial zone. These lines simulate the visual impression of motion and velocity, commonly used in visual storytelling, stylized effects, and dynamic sequences in 3D animation.

The tool integrates seamlessly into Blender’s UI, offering both a parameter panel in the 3D Viewport sidebar and live property controls via a generated controller object. This setup enables users to visualize, adjust, and regenerate speed lines quickly and intuitively, supporting both iterative creative workflows and production-ready scenes.

## Purpose and Use Cases

The add-on is designed to support the creation of stylized visual effects such as:

- Directional motion lines in animation or anime-inspired sequences
- Motion blur surrogates in stylized or non-photorealistic renderings
- Energy or particle streams in sci-fi or fantasy VFX
- Environmental effects such as wind, force fields, or speed chambers
- Visual enhancements for motion-focused storytelling

Its flexibility allows it to be used both in early concept visualization and in final production outputs.

## Core Features

### 1. Configurable Animation Zone
- Define a 3D zone where speed lines are generated
- Adjustable center position and dimensions

### 2. Procedural Line Generation
- Support for three spatial patterns:
  - Radial (from center outward)
  - Parallel (aligned with a flow direction)
  - Random (distributed across a volume)
- Control over the number of lines, length, and variation

### 3. Line Geometry Options
- `Simple`: single edges
- `Tapered`: flat quads with width variation
- `Tube`: 3D cylindrical lines for depth and volume

### 4. Fully Animated
- Keyframed motion across the defined zone
- Continuous cycling with seamless loop support
- Individual line animation offsets for organic motion

### 5. Speed and Timing Presets
- Quick presets (e.g., "Slow", "Fast", "Bullet Time") adjust multiple properties
- Customizable speed multipliers and spawn intervals

### 6. Live Controller Object
- Auto-generated object with real-time property controls
- Enables on-the-fly tuning without re-running generation

### 7. Appearance and Material Integration
- Automatic emission shader creation
- Control over color, brightness, tapering, and transparency
- Optional transparency with alpha blending enabled

## Advantages

- **Fast Setup**: One-click generation of complex animated effects.
- **Flexible Customization**: Adjust every aspect from motion speed to geometry shape.
- **Blender-Native Workflow**: Uses bmesh, animation keyframes, and standard UI components.
- **Non-Destructive Design**: The controller allows live parameter tweaking without needing to rebuild.
- **Loopable Animations**: Designed to cycle continuously, making it ideal for video loops or in-game FX.

## Future Development Goals

To extend the utility of the Animated Speed Lines Generator, several enhancements are planned for upcoming versions:

### 1. Support for Curve-Based Motion
Lines that follow curved paths (Bezier or NURBS), enabling more dynamic or organic trajectories.

### 2. Integration with Force Fields
Ability for lines to be influenced by Blender’s physics system, reacting to turbulence or wind.

### 3. Shader-Based Optimization
For large-scale effects, add a lightweight shader-only version for real-time playback or Eevee compatibility.

### 4. Motion Tracking Integration
Use camera or object motion as a source for generating context-aware speed lines in tracked scenes.

### 5. Custom Pattern Plugin API
Allow advanced users to define and register their own procedural distribution or animation patterns.

### 6. Baking to Keyframes
Option to bake procedural animation to editable keyframes for fine-tuned control or export compatibility.
